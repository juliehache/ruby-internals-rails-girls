# Ruby Internals
#### presented at [Rails Girls TO, July 27 2016](http://www.meetup.com/railsgirlsTO/events/232462550/)

This presentation was *heavily* inspired by Pat Shaughnessy's [Ruby Under a Microscope](http://patshaughnessy.net/ruby-under-a-microscope). Seriously go buy this book, it's really great.
